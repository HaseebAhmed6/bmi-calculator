## Project Overview

At my workplace, there is a huge focus on employee well-being, and as part of these efforts, we are creating a simple BMI (body mass index) calculator web app. This BMI-calculator web app will be part of our broader employee wellness program and will play a key part in our employees being able to monitor their health related to their weight. The wider goal of this web app is to promote a healthy lifestyle which includes the likes of dieting and exercise, leading to overall improved employee health and well-being.

A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is used to determine BMI of individuals, which is a numerical value calculated from their height and weight. The BMI can then be used to categorise individuals into different weight categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.
